# MEME Generator

## What's this??
This is a MEME-generator that I coded a couple of years ago in JavaScript and with help of jQuery.

## How does it work?
You can either link to a file or upload one from your computer. You type in text, click on the "Generate text" button and TA-DA!!!! I've added a Save MEME button which does exactly what you think it would.

## Status?
I've just rediscovered it and plan to work more on it, refacture code, add functions, remove buggs yadadadadadada ENjoy!
